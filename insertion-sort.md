# Insertion Sort Project
Application of insertion sort on two examples.

## First Example: [22,27,16,2,18,6] 

### The steps of insertion sort:
1. [2,27,16,22,18,6] 
2. [2,6,16,22,18,27] 
3. [2,6,16,22,18,27] 
4. [2,6,16,18,22,27] 

### Big-O notation: O(n^2)

### Time Complexity: 
- Average case: n^2
- Worst case: n^2
- Best case: n

- For example, number 18 is included in the average case after the array is sorted. 

## Second Example: [7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15,6] 

### ### The first 4 steps of insertion sort:
1. [2,3,5,8,7,9,4,15,6] 
2. [2,3,4,8,7,9,5,15,6] 
3. [2,3,4,5,7,9,8,15,6] 
4. [2,3,4,5,6,9,8,15,7]
